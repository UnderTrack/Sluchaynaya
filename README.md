List of ideas and projects I plan on to give a try to improve my programming skills.
Currently I will use C++, but prehaps in futur days I'll use lua or rust.

## - **Todo list :**

1. ### - **Virtual PC**
In C++ or lua, something that simulates a PC, aka a CPU at first, then other components.

2. ### - **Game Engine**
A small 2D console game engine, something to test out graphic stuff, something I'm generaly bad at. 
Prehaps may simply end up as a language interpreter.

3. ### - **My Game**
A small Visual Novel game using Unity that I never did much on, it's good to lurn about Unity's scene system and also how it handles events.

4. ### - **Calculator**
Something simple that does more or less complex maths.

5. ### - **Emulator/MiniOS**
Something that could run a small minimalist HMI That would run on a PC, using prehpas the work of my vPC.
